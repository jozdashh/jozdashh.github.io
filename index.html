        <h1>Fox site</h1>

        <p>Just some paragraphs. HTML is not a problem at all, at least for now. Mainly I just want to know how to use css and how to host my website somewhere and be able to access it.</p>

        <p>Is that so much to ask for? It's just that I really don't have a need to build a website. Maybe for my resume and all that stuff, but I really don't need it. However, knowing how to build a website quickly in case an opportunity arises would be something useful. But nothing more than that really. Just for work reasons I don't need MB's of JS data and memory for doing dead simple things like putting up some information or setting forms or stuff like that.</p>

        <p>Test. I Just want to see wheter I need divs or not. CSS is what I need to learn for now. Then I would do some of the courses I guess and start building a portfolio. What I think would be cool is to build fast and all neat clones of existing websites, like for example a reddit clone of some sort, that looks pretty. And experiments and stuff like that. Maybe doing things like:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Put in some fancy buttons that feel and look neat</li>
        <li>Setup it up so I can upload files like pngs and videos and to be able to visualize them</li>
        <li>Setup a music player</li>
        <li>Put up gifs</li>
        <li>Setup a blog section where I can list some of my random thoughts</li>
        <li>Put a list of my current watch list or todo list of things I have to do</li>
        <li>Build a 4chan clone (maybe)</li>
        <li>Build a Reddit clone (maybe)</li>
        <li>Build a Youtube clone, but for my local video files (hey, that'd be cool)</li>
        <li>Setup a chatroom and send messages and store them in the database</li>
        <li>Setup an online converter with ffmpeg most likely. So it's super quick. webp to pngs, webm to mp4 and stuff like that, maybe</li>
        <li>And maybe some creative things. I could really go ham and just make it pure brain puke and go nuts with pictures and themes and general ambiance</li>
        <li>Maybe build a webapp within it that lets me idk, draw things perhaps? Could be. Then the drawings would be saved in a gallery view.</li>
        <li>Could be interesting, all of that.</li>
        </ul>
