        <h1>Fox site</h1>

        <p>Just some paragraphs. Just testing some simple HTML and CSS styling. I've got the Github Page setup already, so that's a tick of the list.</p>

        <p>I really don't have a need to build a website. Maybe I'd be only useful for something like a resume or cv. However, knowing how to build a website quickly in case an opportunity arises would be something useful. But nothing more than that really. I don't need MB's of JS scripts for doing dead simple things like putting up some text and images and forms.</p>

        <p>Some experiments and website clones:</p>

        <ul>
        <li>Fancy buttons</li>
        <li>Fancy menus</li>
        <li>Fancy sidebars</li>
        <li>Image/animated image and video file uploading and instant visualization gallery</li>
        <li>Music player</li>
        <li>Blog section</li>
        <li>Current reading and watch list</li>
        <li>Imageboard like-site</li>
        <li>Youtube clone or setting up a PeerTube instance</li>
        <li>Chatroom</li>
        <li>Setup an online converter with ffmpeg.</li>
        <li>Experimental sites with multiple layers of images</li>
        <li>Paint-like or drawing board webapp</li>
        <li>All of those are interesting.</li>
        </ul>
